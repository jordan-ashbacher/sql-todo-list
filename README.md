SQL To Do List

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hour Challenge_

This application is created to track upcoming and completed tasks. It allows the user to input a new task and select the date that the task should be completed by. It is then rendered to the DOM with the uncompleted tasks listed at the top and completed tasks rendered to the bottom. A task may be deleted by clicking the delete button or it can be marked completed by clicking the checkmark button. Once completed the task is greyed out, the text is struckthrough and a time completed stamp is added to the task.
